          <p>Weekend of August 27-28 2011 almost did not happen.   Baldwin Beach was closed the week before.  Erosion was particulary bad this year.  Also, construction/renovation of the pavillion forced authorities to close even the main entrance.  But grounds were opened for Saturday and Sunday, setting the stage for another glorious weekend of cricket to add to our memories, much thanks to our visiting friends from the <a href="http://honolulucricketclub.org/" target="_blank">Honolulu Cricket Club</a>.</p>

<p>Oahu won both games (eventually, comprehensively).  Maui put up a fierce fight all the way.  The games were not as one-sided as the scores suggest.  However, Team Maui needs to imagine what could have been accomplished with a bit more practice.  Especially, anticipating the Pan Pacific Cup in May 2012.</p>

<p>On Saturday, August 27, the 20/20 match got going briskly with Oahu batsmen retiring one after another after hitting around the park to their hearts content.  Except for couple of hopeful breakthroughs by <strong>Gary Richmond</strong> and <strong>Uday Kari</strong> the Oahu innings did not lose any early wickets.  Plenty of easy catches dropped.  Ended up setting up a massive target of over 180 to chase down at 1.5 runs per ball.  Maui answered well with their in-form captain <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> settling down to hit 42 runs before being retired at the request of a concerned Oahu team.  At the point of Danny's retirement, Maui was almost tracking Oahu run for run and, more importantly, had lost just one wicket.  With Danny's departure, the innings unraveled in painful slow motion, run-rate dropping behind progressively.  However, the team still managed over 120 runs, at a respectable run-rate of over one run a ball.</p>  

<p>Sunday, August 28, a longer format 40 over match was played.  Tent pavillion went up, music was on, the barbeque was cooking, plenty of drinks.  Maui went into bat first.  Again, <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> provided a solid opening, top scoring with 65 runs.  He was ably supported by <strong>Baz Cumberhatch</strong> and <strong>Troy Kippins</strong> scoring 21 runs each.  Maui set a target of 190 runs.  Post lunch, team Oahu was pinned down.  Runs were scrace.  The Maui pace quartet of <strong>Gary Richmond</strong>, <strong>Andrew Wallace</strong>, <strong>Baz Cumberhatch</strong> and <strong>Chris Sutherland</strong> were bowling fluently, keeping a lid on hitting.  A superb catch behind the wicket by <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> started an early slide of Oahu wickets.  Maui was pumped up.  However, a couple of expensive overs due to lusty hitting by <strong>Rahu Vijayakumar</strong>, set the stage for an Oahu recovery.  Also, <strong>Barry Watt</strong> seemed to hang around forever at one end, puting up runs regularly.  Oahu ended up needing a little over three (3) runs per over to win after drinks break at half-time (20 overs).  Oahu went about acquiring this target methodically.  Preserving wickets, scoring with singles and twos.  When the field came in, they lobbed boundaries.  And so on.  All neatly wrapped up in the end by tailenders <strong>Mark Berwick</strong> and <strong>Zubin Menon</strong>.  It was that close.  Couple of more wickets and Team Oahu would have had to rethink their standard operating procedure of playing a whole day of cricket after partying hard till 4 AM. </p>
