          <p>Build it, they will come!  Year 2012 is shaping up to be quite a foreign invasion.  Starting with the friendly matches of <a href="http://honolulucricketclub.org/PanPacificCup.html" target="_blank">Pan Pacific Cup 2012</a>, in which MCC fielded players on both Oahu and Maui,  <a href="#">Brookfield Brumbies Cricket Club</a> from Brisbane, Australia, became the first internationally traveling cricket club to visit the Valley Isle after there was a pitch to play on.   Arguably they were beaten to it by a member of the <a href="http://cromfordmeadows.play-cricket.com/teams/teams.asp" target="_blank">Cromford Meadows Cricket Club</a> from England (Peak District of Derbyshire), <strong>Les Kirk</strong>, who actually joined MCC for the said friendly matches on Oahu.  And now, we have had the best treat, the first OFFICIAL visitors - the <a href="http://www.epcc.com.au/" target="_blank">Emu Plains Cricket Club</a>, who started their Hawaii 2012 tour in Maui along with the  <a href="http://honolulucricketclub.org/" target="_blank">Honolulu Cricket Club</a> on July 7-8.</p>
  
  <p>There was some confusion surrounding the Brumbiess visit.  Would they come to Maui?  Would the <a href="http://honolulucricketclub.org/PanPacificCup.html" target="_blank">Pan Pacific Cup 2012</a>, include matches at  Baldwin?  The answer to the first question, YES, was lost lost in the fog of tournament, whereby, the answer to second question became, unfortunately, NO.  So four Maui guys, <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong>, <strong>Troy Kippins</strong>, <strong>Uday Kari</strong> and <strong>Les Kirk</strong>  went to Oahu to play the visitors in friendly matches following the Pan Pacific Cup on Sunday 27.  Two 20/20 matches were played.  Maui boys joined &quot;Northern Hemisphere&quot; for the first match, and &quot;Rest of the World&quot; for the second match.  Lost both matches; but <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> shined with the bat for Northern Hemisphere, top scoring with 32 runs.  Came right back to Maui to hastily organize a ten over pick up match on the evening of Tuesday May 29 at Baldwin, teams made-up of whoever showed up!  <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> captained his team to chase down 103 runs.  Then we all went to <a href="http://charleysmaui.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">Charley's</a> in Paia.  Most memorable was the Brookfield player(?) who somehow managed to dislocate a finger bone.  Iced it, and then came right back to bat - doubling up in pain and cursing every single shot - even the boundaries.  Now that is a real cricket player. </p> 
  
  <p>There was no mistaking the Emu Plains visit.  The Maui team may be depleted without key players like opening batsman, all rounder <strong>Andrew Wallace</strong> and fast bowler <strong>Gary Richmond</strong>, but we were determined to be the best hosts we could be.  Honolulu Cricket Club played the visitors' first match in Hawaii on July 7.    35-overs.  It was a highly contrived close match.  Much of it played in there-must-be-a-Hawaiian-name-for-this rain.  It was shining all day, every day, until Friday.  O well.  Emu Plains could have ended the HCC chase of 129 after Honolulu went down to their last man - who never played cricket in his entire life before this day.  The true <a href="http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/spirit/" target="_blank">spirit of cricket</a> came out - unwritten law - thou shall treat new comers (and children) gently.  Not taking anything away from Honolulu captain <strong>Subbu Raman</strong> who top-scored with 41 not out, including sheparding the win in the dicey last wicket stand.  He also led the bowling figures, taking 3 for 18. </p>
  
 <p>Sunday, July 8, the rain started worse.  Maui captain <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> won the toss, and true to his preference to chase, put Emu Plains (EP) led today by <strong>Andrew Lou Luzzi</strong>, in to bat - in the rain - again.   But the visitors did much better with the bat, lighting up Maui for 175 runs, setting up a 5-run per over chase.  The partnership between identical twins <strong>Ange Barbaro</strong>, 31 runs, and <strong>Sam Barbaro</strong>, 23 runs, seemed to last forever.  It even endured a temporary lapse in the ability to procreate right there on the pitch, should opportunities arise.  Naked ladies are known dance up there during the game.  Knocked up, not just once, but twice, in the batteries by paceman <strong>Rahu &quot;Malinga&quot; Vijaykumar</strong>.  We are yet to determine if both of them shared the same fate, as when they were born, or if just one of them got his set balanced out!   Thank the cricket Gods for the box (cup), no need for ambulance.  To Maui's relief, <strong>Ange Barbaro</strong> eventually played <strong>Uday Kari</strong> on to his off-stump.  With the opening partnership(s) broken, wickets came at a steady pace for Maui, with <strong>Glaston &quot;Baz&quot; Cumberhatch</strong>, <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> and <strong>Rahu Vijaykumar</strong> controling the temple end, while others chipped in at the street end.  <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> and <strong>Rahu Vijaykumar</strong> swapped wicket keeping and bowling duties.  Except for one or two overs, it was pretty tight.  <strong>Chris Sutherland</strong> took an amazing catch, pouching it kangaroo style, at the long on boundary off <strong>James &quot;Jai&quot; Richmond</strong>.   Bowling-wise, <strong>Glaston &quot;Baz&quot; Cumberhatch</strong> bested everyone today taking 2 wickets for Maui, giving away just 25 runs.  Top scorer for EP was, again, <strong>Greg Botrill</strong>, 35 not out; yesterday he made 36 against HCC. </p>
 
 <p>In response, Maui innings started with a heart attack, losing opener <strong>Chris Sutherland</strong> to a golden duck - most unfortunate stumping.  Here we go, again, was the feeling in the pavillion.  However, the partnership for the second wicket, between <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> and <strong>Uday Kari</strong> yielded 76 runs from 12 overs.  Every attempt was made to calibrate effort to the required run rate.  Both batsmen survived multiple close calls, until <strong>Uday Kari</strong> managed to get run-out on 12 by <strong>Ange Barbaro</strong> after being judged plumb leg-before by everyone, except the umpire - who thought there was no LBW.  Enter <strong>Rahu Vijaykumar</strong> who, in character, went berserk, hitting almost every single ball for a boundary - 4 or 6 - no singles or doubles, Much Mahalo!  By drinks break, 16th over, Maui had amassed 135 runs.  <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong>, 67 runs, and <strong>Rahu Vijaykumar</strong>, 35 runs, retired to give others a chance at the bat.  <strong>Joel Loung</strong> belted a brisk 19.  With all that fiery action behind, the asking run-rate became fewer than the overs left.  <strong>Wakhimba Mills</strong> had the luxury, then, of playing 16 dot balls to score a run in support of <strong>Allen Greenridge</strong> who scored the winning single in the 26th over.  Both elder statesmen were not out on 1.</p>   
 
 <p>Special Mahalo to <strong>Chris Sutherland</strong> and family for organizing the amazing BBQ and pavillion while also attending a wedding Saturday evening, <strong>Joel Loung</strong> and <strong>Troy Kippins</strong> for DJ-ing, powered by generator.
