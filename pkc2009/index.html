          <p>October 17-18, 2009 was a memorable cricket weekend.  An annual inter-island cricket match was institutionalized as part of the <a href="http://isleofmauipipeband.com/index.php?page=princess-ka-iulani-festival" target="_blank">Princess Ka`iulani Festival</a>.  On Saturday, we had a great time on the grounds of the Haleakala Waldorf School in Kula showing <a href="keiki.html" target="_blank">keiki</a> how to play with a Kanga Cricket Set (a gentle introduction to the game) much mahalos to our friends from the <a href="http://www.honolulucricketclub.org" target="_blank">Honolulu Cricket Club</a>).  Most priceless moment, reported by <strong>Andrew Wallace</strong>: little girl trying to hit the plastic stumps with the ball, any which way possible, while running around and dodging the bewildered batsmen.  On Sunday, the big boys played a friendly (mixed teams) match, tagged Maui and Oahu at Baldwin Beach, Paia, the net result of which is that the trophy stays on Maui (for now).  Photos, details below.</p>

<p>But first, we are most grateful to the <a href="http://isleofmauipipeband.com/index.php?page=sponsors" target="_blank">sponsors</a> of the Princess Ka`iulani Cricket Cup, particularly, <strong>Norman Mizuno</strong> and <strong>Alan Davidson</strong> for initiating contact with the Maui Cricket Club and coordinating all the logistics.  Lunch served by <strong>Keokea Homested Farm Lots Association</strong>, was a big hit, especially the Lau Lau entree.  A most authentic <a href="hires/trophy2.JPG" target="_blank">trophy</a> was made by <strong>John Grant</strong>, a founder of the <a href="http://www.isleofmauipipeband.com" target="_blank">Isle Of Maui Pipe Band</a>.   Perhaps for the first time, we had a decent <a href="hires/pavillion.JPG" target="_blank">pavillion</a> thanks to <strong>Chris Sutherland</strong> and his friends at <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/connec.us" target="_blank">Connec LLC, Kula</a>.  Just a few days before the match, the <a href="http://www.co.maui.hi.us/index.aspx?nid=119"  target="_blank">County of Maui</a> mowed the grass at Baldwin Park giving the grounds a first-class feeling.  Mahalo to <a href="http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/524714.html?nav=11" target="_blank">The Maui News</a> for prominently featuring cricket as a part of the buildup toward the Princess Ka`iulani Festival.  Finally, we are most appreciative of <a href="http://www.kalanienglish.com/" target="_blank">Senator J. Kalani English</a> to have taken the time on a weekend to join us all at Baldwin Park to present the trophy in addition to being a sponsor of the Princess Ka`iulani Festival.</p>

<p><a href="hires/maui.JPG" target="_blank">Team Maui</a> was led by <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong>, while Team Oahu which was formed under <strong>Travis Wilkinson</strong>.  After winning the toss, Danny decided to do what he loves most: to chase a given run target.  Openers <strong>Andrew Wallace</strong> and <strong>Travis Wilkinson</strong> provided Oahu a most auspicious start putting up 78 runs for the first wicket.  But man-of-the-match <strong>Vishan Dookhu</strong> struck three quick blows, destroying the middle order in a single over, on his way to cleaning up half the team at the end of the innings.  With some decent batting at the end, Oahu was set  to defend 175, having been bowled all out with a couple of overs to spare in the alloted 35 over game.  Team Maui cautiously started the innings, with the run-rate trailing slightly all the way to the 12th over.  In over 13, the game changed explosively as <strong>Munna Hussein</strong> and <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> ganged up to thrash 24 runs in a single over from <strong>Andrew Wallace</strong>.  There was no looking back after that as Team Maui seem to loose all respect for the bowling: batsman after batsman retired to allow everyone a bit part in the score.  The total of 176 was achieved with 10 overs to spare.  </p>
