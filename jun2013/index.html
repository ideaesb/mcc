          <p><a href="http://honolulucricketclub.org/" target="_blank">Honolulu Cricket Club</a> (HCC) and <a href="http://www.epcc.com.au/" target="_blank">Emu Plains Cricket Club</a> (EPCC), once again jump started the cricket scene on Maui, playing a limited 35-over match on Saturday, June 29 and a 20-over match on Sunday, June 30, 2013.  We were honored to be joined by <strong>Ozair Nana</strong>, captain of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marincricketclub/" target="_blank">Marin Cricket Club</a> 1st XI in the <a href="http://ncalcricket.org/" target="_blank">Northern California Cricket Association</a> (NCCA) - champions of the NCCA A division.  Other noteable recent visits to our cricket ground included <strong>Ken Williams</strong>, ex-USA player, from Atlanta <a href="http://www.tropicalsportsclub.net/" target="_blank">Tropical Sports Club</a> and <strong>Nick Ryan</strong>, en-route to employment in Canada, who referred to <strong><a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/player/5390.html" target="_blank">Adam Gilchrist</a></strong> as..."yeah, he was my mate".  Could not convince/pay Ken or Nick to stay and play for Maui June 29-30, but Nick's brother <strong>Dan Ryan</strong> is now confirmed, committed team member.  Welcome, Dan! </p>
          
          
          <p>Saturday June 29, EPCC joined Maui to battle HCC in a 35-over match.  Put in to bat bat first, HCC quickly lost a bunch of wickets to some tight bowling by <strong>Baz Cumberhatch</strong> and <strong>Andrew Kennedy</strong>.  Then, <strong>Mark Berwick</strong> and <strong>Barry Watt</strong> stabilized the innings playing defensive shots, stealing singles whenever possible...until suddenly exploding, Mark taking 14 runs off <strong>Dan Ryan</strong> to retire at 40, Barry soon following, 36.  Then came captain <strong>Subbu Raman</strong>, top scoring with 43, non-chalant, cavalier.  The Maui/EPCC attack seemed to be fading, until we discovered our most potent bowling talent for the day, <strong>Joel Loung</strong>.   Brought in late in the game, Joel took 4 wickets, dismantling the HCC lower order - almost getting a hat-trick.  His figures at one point were 3 wickets in 9 balls no runs, giving new meaning to "grown here, not flown here".  As a result, for the first time ever, HCC were completely bowled out.  The Maui chase, led by <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong>, 36 not out, began in earnest, with useful contributions from <strong>Troy Kippins</strong> not out on 30, <strong>Ozair Nana</strong>, <strong>Joel Loung</strong> and <strong>Jim Micsko</strong> but came up 6 runs short.  Coulda-shoulda: Joel, bowl earlier,  Troy bat earlier and then going for broke just to have Danny return from retirement, finish off the game, if necessary...and, needless to say, stopped a few boundaries and taken a catch or two.  One word: practice.</p>
          
          <p>Sunday June 30, Maui played HCC/EPCC in a 20-over match, 10 players each side with <strong>Charles Eberly</strong> of HCC playing on both teams.  Batting first, team HCC/EPCC accumulated 149 runs, with notable contribution from, what seemed like, half their batsmen who either retired at 20 as agreed or remained not out.  During the chase, Maui made no mistake this time, allowing <strong>Daniel Lovell</strong> return from retirement to smash 59 runs including two huge sixes to achieve the target with one over to spare and also allowing for some test-match style batting in the middle. <strong>Joel Loung</strong> and <strong>Dan Ryan</strong> remained unbeaten at 20 runs each above 100% strike rate, <strong>Wakhimba Mills</strong> achieved his best score of 12.</p>
          
          <p>Sunday evening, post-game, included spirited discussion of taking the Maui club to the next level of operations.  We have come far and are here to stay.  We have been part of the island scene, each regular player investing tremendous time and effort to make cricket, the second most popular team sport after soccer, an attraction on Maui for countless residents and tourists - arriving by ships, planes and super-ferry.  We have represented every test playing nation on earth, including the <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/141170.html" target="_blank">first one to play internationally</a> - right here on Baldwin Beach, on a single Saturday afternoon.  Earned County support for our pitch, celebrated the Kingdom of Hawaii in a couple of tournaments.  It is time for us to engage local sponsors and others for mutual benefit.  Lets get all the trappings of a real team - graphics, design, uniforms, apparel, accessories, (new) equipment, practice nets, trophies, gifts, souvenirs, canopy tents, furnishings, storage, summer camps, carpet and cameras, insurance and first-aid.  Lets tour internationally and have a club house here on Maui (why not?).   </p>
<p><u>Most important</u>: scrimmage every Saturday afternoon.  In other words, time to get really serious about fun!</p>
